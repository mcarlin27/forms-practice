        <h1>A Wild Ride!</h1>
        <p>This morning, I, <span class="person1"></span> and <span class="person2"></span>, my best friend, decided to go to a <span class="sport"></span> game. We love <span class="sport"></span>! The game was really crowded, but somehow <span class="person2"></span> got us great seats right up front. The game was really intense. We were rooting for <span class="team"></span>, but with only seconds on the clock they were losing by one <span class="score">. Suddenly, a <span class="animal"></span> ran across the field. As it ran, the <span class="animal"></span> got bigger and bigger! By the time the <span class="animal"></span> reached the players, it was bigger than a car. The players and crowd panicked. It was pandamonium! Everyone was screaming. Then, over the intercom I heard a familiar voice. 'Everybody, be quiet!' the voice boomed. It was <span class="authority"></span>, my high school principal. 'This is all <span class="person1"></span>'s fault,' <span class="authority"></span>'s voice announced. All eyes turned to me. I began to sweat. The <span class="animal"></span> whipped around and began charging at me. I screamed! Then, suddenly, I was in my bed at home. It was all a dream. The game is actually tonight!</p>
